# CS452 - Parallel Algorithms
Language: C++\
Professor: Dr. Ankur Gupta\
*January - May 2024*

## Description
This repository contains all of the projects from my CS452 course taken at Butler University during the 2024 spring semester. 
This course focuses on the study of theoretical and practical paradigms of parallel algorithm design. Topics covered include model costs, lower bounds, data-parallelism, synchronization, message passing, and parallel design for sorting, graphs, string processing, and dynamic programming.

## Projects 
1. *Lord of the Rings*
  - **Two Rings** -- The "first ring" sends messages from process 0 to the next even process, and the "second ring" sends messages from process 1 to the next odd process.
  - **Whack-An-Orc** -- Find maximum, minimum, and average value of a very large array of integer numbers.
  - **In Your EYE** -- Read in a text file full of letters and figure out how many of each letter there are.
2. *A Minor Character Can Still Drink Heavily* -- Mergesort algorithm.
3. *Clone Wars Full of Goodness* -- "Parallel" version of mergesort algorithm (pmerge).
4. *COVINS-20* -- Implementation of a 2-3 tree.
